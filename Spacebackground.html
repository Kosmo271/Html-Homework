<h1>Space background</h1> <img src="Space vertical background.webp" alt="space"><br>
<p class="text-white">Space—an endless expanse stretching beyond imagination. It's endless expanse which encopases planets, stars, black holes, satalites, life and everything in between, yet we know little to nothing about it. <br><br>
    
    Space challenges every boundary we thought we understood. Each celestial body holds clues to the past and possibilities for the future. Planets like Mars and moons like Europa fuel our dreams of exploration and inspire the next generations to step forward in this quest for knowladge. <br><br>
     
    Whether it's the crackling silence of a vacuum or the violent beauty of a supernova, space remains both elegant and terrifying. And yet, despite its vastness, space makes us feel deeply connected—not just to each other, but to a shared curiosity that spans cultures and generations. Humanity's journey into space isn’t just about discovering new worlds. It's about understanding our place in the grand design.</p>
